Testing CI/CD

I am yet another random nerd on the internet. I am a computer nerd, a music
nerd and a food nerd. I have an unhealthy tendency to dive down too many rabbit
holes.
</p>
<p>
Despite my original background being on biochemistry and bioinformatics, I am
currently employed as a data engineer.
</p>
<p>
I am a free/libre and open source advocate and a DIY obsessive and a
post-leftist solarpunk. I highly value technological sovereignty and personal
privacy.
</p>
<p>
I am a fan of music in general and of heavy experimental stuff
in particular.
</p>
<p>
I feel the most comfortable within *nix systems and find
functional programming the most enjoyable.
