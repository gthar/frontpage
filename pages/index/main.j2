<p>I am yet another random nerd on the internet. I am a
computer nerd, a music nerd, a fermentation nerd and a beer
nerd. I have an unhealthy tendency to dive down too many
rabbit holes.</p>
<p>Despite my original background being on biochemistry and
bioinformatics, I am currently employed as a data
engineer/backend developer.</p>
<p>I am a free/libre and open source advocate and a DIY
obsessive. I highly value technological sovereignty and
personal privacy.</p>
<p>I am a fan of music in general and of weird heavy shit
in particular.</p>
<p>I feel the most comfortable within *nix systems and find
functional programming the most enjoyable.</p>

trivial preferences of mine.</p>
